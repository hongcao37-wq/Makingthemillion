        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect information when you visit our website (the "Site"). We are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect minimal information automatically through standard web server logs, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>IP address</li>
            <li>Browser type and version</li>
            <li>Referring page and pages visited</li>
            <li>Date and time of visit</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not collect personal information like names, emails, or any data you enter into the calculator (everything runs locally in your browser—no data is sent to our server).</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>In the future, we may use services like Google Analytics to understand site usage and improve the tool. If enabled:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Analytics may collect anonymized data about your visit (e.g., pages viewed, time spent).</li>
            <li>Data is processed according to Google's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</li>
            <li>You can opt out via the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If we add advertising (e.g., Google AdSense), third-party advertisers may use cookies for personalized ads. Their practices are covered by their own privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>Currently, this site uses no cookies. If we add analytics or ads in the future, we will update this policy and may use cookies for functionality and performance.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>Any collected data is used only to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improve site performance and user experience</li>
            <li>Analyze anonymous usage statistics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not sell, share, or disclose your information to third parties except as required by law or through the services mentioned above.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect information, but no online transmission is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Changes will be posted here with an updated date.</p>
