        <p>The S&P 500 is an index tracking the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. It's widely regarded as the best gauge of the U.S. stock market and economy.</p>

        <h2>Historical Performance</h2>
        <p>Since 1928, the S&P 500 has delivered an average annual total return (including dividends reinvested) of approximately:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>~10–10.5%</strong> nominal (before inflation)</li>
            <li><strong>~7%</strong> real (after inflation)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This long-term average is why many financial planners and calculators (like this one) use 7–10% as a reasonable expected return for long-term stock market investing.</p>

        <h2>Why Invest in the S&P 500?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Diversification across 500 companies and all major sectors</li>
            <li>Low-cost index funds/ETFs (e.g., VOO, SPY) make it easy and affordable</li>
            <li>Historically outperforms most active fund managers over the long term</li>
            <li>Compound growth turns consistent contributions into significant wealth</li>
        </ul>
