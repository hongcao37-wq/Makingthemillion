<h2>What Is the S&P 500?</h2>
            <p>The S&P 500 is a stock market index that tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. It includes giants like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, Google, Tesla, and hundreds more across every major sector.</p>
            
            <p>Created in 1957 by Standard & Poor’s, it’s widely regarded as the best gauge of the overall U.S. stock market and the economy.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                When people say “the market is up,” they’re almost always talking about the S&P 500.

            <h2>Final Thought: Keep It Simple</h2>
            <p>You don’t need to be a genius or spend hours researching stocks to build serious wealth. The S&P 500 has made millionaires out of ordinary teachers, nurses, and factory workers who simply invested consistently over decades.</p>
            
            <p>The million isn’t found in hot tips or timing the market. It’s found in owning a piece of America’s most successful companies — and giving them time to grow.</p>
